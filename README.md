<p align="center">Demo project for my tutorial about creating an Ally AI that can follow the player around or lead them around the level.<p>

This is the demo project for the tutorial at [Unreal C++ Creating a Follow/Lead AI](https://robertcorponoi.com/unreal-c-creating-an-ai-that-follows-and-leads/) which explains how to set up a an AI that can follow the player around or lead them to spots around the level.

This demo was created with Unreal 4.25.3

## Instructions

- Clone or download the repo, open it in Unreal, and press play.

- Move around to have the AllyCharacter follow you around. You can also hold shift to sprint and if you get far enough from the AllyCharacter they will sprint to catch up with you.

- Press the F key to have the AllyCharacter lead you to a couple spots around the level. If you get too far from the AllyCharacter they will stop moving until you get closer and then they'll continue to where they were going before.

The AllyCharacter has various variables you can modify to adjust speed and other distance related logic.
